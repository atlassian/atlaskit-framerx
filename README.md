# **Atlaskit** for **Framer** X

Atlaskit is Atlassian's official UI library, built according to the Atlassian Design Guidelines. This repository focuses on the port of Atlaskit to Framer X.  
  
More info on Atlaskit and its specifications can be found in the **Sources** section.

----

## Why **Framer** X?
Because Framer X is based on the same web technologies that the Atlaskit components are based on üòç. That makes designing with Atlaskit components much easier and more true-to-life than ever before.

## **Contributing** / **Editing**
Just open up the `Atlaskit.framerx` file in Framer X and your editor of choice and start editing!  

The `.framerx` file is now a folder-based project instead of a file based one. This should result in
easier editing and collaborating. Once you're done, create a branch and submit a pull request.
